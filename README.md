# decoderflask

This is an IST440 final project for Fall 2019. The web service is designed to accept an image of cyphered text and use Ocular Charachter Recognition (OCR) and open source decypher modules to decode a message and translate it into English.

Run server_setup.sh to create a new server space. The service uses Flask, Nginx, Redis Queue, secretpy, googletrans, and sqlite3.
